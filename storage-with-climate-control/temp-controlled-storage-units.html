UT The city of Austin is located just to the north of the downtown region, and the West Campus/West University neighborhood is popular among students because it is filled with coffee shops, eateries that provide small bites, and residences that are geared toward young adults ages 18 to 25.  <br><br>  This includes protection from rain, snow, wind, and hailstorm, which can all cause damage to your recreational vehicle gradually.
