Smaller storage units, which range in size from 5x5 to 5x10, will typically be less expensive than larger storage units, such as 10x10 and larger. The facilities and unique characteristics of the storage units are additional variables that may drive up the cost of self-storage. The cost of self-storage facilities in Austin, Texas that include extra features like first floor storage options, elevators, extra security features, indoor climate control, and 24-hour access to storage is typically higher than that of facilities that only provide basic services."
