Smaller storage units, which range in size from 5x5 to 5x10, will typically be less expensive than larger storage units, such as 10x10 and larger. The facilities and unique characteristics of the storage units are additional variables that may drive up the cost of self-storage. The cost of self-storage facilities in Austin, Texas that include extra features like first floor storage options, elevators, extra security features, indoor climate control, and 24-hour access to storage is typically higher than that of facilities that only provide basic services."

With the arrival of major corporations like Google and Tesla, employment in Austin is expected to raise by 47% in the following decade.  <br><br>  The first self-storage facility in Europe was begun in the UK by Doug Hampson, and opened in central London in 1979.  The Austin metro area job market is also expected to see a 26% increase between 2020 and 2030, which means an additional 180,000 jobs.  Because of its absence of state revenue tax, it's still extra inexpensive than many significant cities, and its high salaries assist offset several of the extra expenses.  <br><br>  This provides an additional layer of safety and provides tenants the piece of mind of having someone constantly on the facilities.  Austin's typical home value from 2017 to 2021 was estimated by the Census to be $381,400.  You may feel comfortable knowing that your possessions are secure and safe while in storage if you choose a facility that fits your needs.  <br><br></p>

Smaller storage units, which range in size from 5x5 to 5x10, will typically be less expensive than larger storage units, such as 10x10 and larger.
